<b>Ace</b> is a little soldier’s pup! His owner is in the navy and often has to go out to sea for long stretches — one trip lasted almost a month, and another nearly four! Little Ace spent all his adorable puppy months with me, so I almost feel bad that his owner missed that stage 😭.
His owner actually found me all the way from San Diego and drove hours just to drop Ace off — I was so touched by that level of trust! Every time, the owner disappears right after drop-off and only manages to message me once in a while when there’s internet.
Ace himself is super easygoing — the only time he goes crazy is when he sees his leash, literally jumping like he’s launching into space 🚀. When he first came, he didn’t really know how to socialize, but now he’s become a total social butterfly, making tons of doggie friends! Whenever he meets another dog, he’ll raise his little butt high to show he’s friendly — absolutely adorable.
